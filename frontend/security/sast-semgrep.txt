          Conditions for Nginx H2C smuggling       
          identified. H2C smuggling allows         
          upgrading HTTP/1.1 connections to lesser-
          known HTTP/2 over cleartext (h2c)        
          connections which can allow a bypass of  
          reverse proxy access controls, and lead  
          to long-lived, unrestricted HTTP traffic 
          directly to back-end servers. To         
          mitigate: WebSocket support required:    
          Allow only the value websocket for       
          HTTP/1.1 upgrade headers (e.g., Upgrade: 
          websocket). WebSocket support not        
          required: Do not forward Upgrade headers.
